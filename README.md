**Cardsauce** is a Vinesauce-themed expansion for Balatro, made in collaboration with the Balatro Discord and Vinesauce communities! Featuring art from several talented artists, Cardsauce adds 50 new Jokers, as well as a handful of other new additions to the game.

## Installation

This mod requires [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and the latest version of [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) **(Version 1.0.0~ALPHA-1203a or later)**. Without these dependencies, this mod will not function.

Once you've installed both lovely and Steammodded, download the latest release zip file and put the folder inside it in your Balatro Mods folder (`%APPDATA%/Balatro/Mods`). That's it!

**NOTE:** If you are downloading the mod using the source code, **remember to remove '-main' from the folder name for Cardsauce!** You may run into issues if it's not removed.

## Credits
Created by **BarrierTrio/Gote** in collaboration with **Keku**

Detailed credits for everyone else who contributed to the mod can be found in-game in Cardsauce's credits tab in the Mods menu. There are too many names to list here and some credits spoil a bit of the stuff you'll discover in the mod, so just download it and see it all for yourself!
 A huge thank you to all the artists from Artcord Collaberative and the Vinesauce discord who joined the project, your help means the world! ðŸ’š
